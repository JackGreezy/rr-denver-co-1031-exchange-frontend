**Issue Identified:**
Google Images extraction is consistently returning empty arrays, suggesting:
1. Possible automated access detection by Google
2. DOM structure changes in Google Images
3. Images may be loading via different mechanisms (base64, lazy loading, etc.)

**Recommendations:**
1. Try Bing Images fallback (as specified in instructions)
2. Increase wait times between requests
3. Process remaining locations in separate sessions with longer delays
4. Consider manual image selection for critical locations
